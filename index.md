Hi! These are some of my projects and stuff.

## Active projects

These are projects I am actively working on.

* [HuasoHuare](https://jbahamon.github.io/HuasoWare): A WarioWare but with
chilean-themed microgames.

## Inactive projects

Projects I'll probably work on at some point. 

* [CTM](https://jbahamon.github.io/CTM): A MUGEN-based fighting game involving
* Chrono Trigger's characters.

## Completed projects

Probably won't work on these.

* [rainbowify](https://github.com/jbahamon/rainbowify): An Octave script for
* creating colorful frames for trippy GIFs.

* [media-analysis](https://github.com/jbahamon/media-analysis): A bunch of
* scripts I used for my Master's thesis.

* [quantum-test](https://github.com/jbahamon/quantum-test): A test to determine
which Quantum Mechanics interpretation is the most compatible with you. Take the
test [here](https://jbahamon.github.io/quantum-test/index.html).

## Abandoned projects

For one reason or another, these projects have been abandoned and are only kept
for archival purposes.

* [dunno](): A modular platdformer engine, intended to be a "versus" platformer. 
Abandoned because, well, Super Mario Bros. 35 ended up implementing the idea in
a superior way.

* [DudoBot](https://github.com/jbahamon/dudo-bot): A bot that allows people to
play a variant of Liar's Dice on Telegram. Abandoned because the gameplay loop
ended up being too confusing for players :(
