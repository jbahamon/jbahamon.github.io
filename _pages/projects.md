These are some of my projects and stuff.

## Active projects

These are projects I am actively working on.

* [Kadath](https://github.com/jbahamon/Kadath) (in-progress name). A JRPG based on H.P. Lovecraft's "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath". 
Made using Godot. I might try to extract some libraries that could be used for other projectst from here (see [DialogBoxes](https://github.com/jbahamon/DialogBoxes) and [Keyboard-based Tab Container](https://github.com/jbahamon/godot-keyboard-based-tab-container) as rough, early examples)

## Inactive projects

Projects I might come back to at some point. 

* [HuasoWare](https://github.com/jbahamon/HuasoWare): A WarioWare but with
chilean-themed microgames. Made in Godot. Try it out [here](http://anakena.dcc.uchile.cl/~jbahamon/HuasoWare/HuasoWare.html).

* [CTM](https://jbahamon.github.io/CTM): A MUGEN-based fighting game involving
Chrono Trigger's characters.

## Completed projects

Probably won't work on these.

* [rainbowify](https://github.com/jbahamon/rainbowify): An Octave script for 
creating colorful frames for trippy GIFs.

* [media-analysis](https://github.com/jbahamon/media-analysis): A bunch of 
scripts I used for my Master's thesis.

* [quantum-test](https://github.com/jbahamon/quantum-test): A test to determine
which Quantum Mechanics interpretation is the most compatible with you. Take the
test [here](https://jbahamon.github.io/quantum-test/index.html).

## Abandoned projects

For one reason or another, these projects have been abandoned and are only kept
for archival purposes.

* [dunno](https://jbahamon.github.com/dunno): A modular platformer engine,
intended to be a "versus" platformer.  Abandoned because, well, Super Mario
Bros. 35 ended up implementing the idea in a superior way.

* [DudoBot](https://github.com/jbahamon/dudo-bot): A bot that allows people to
play a variant of Liar's Dice on Telegram. Abandoned because the gameplay loop
ended up being too confusing for players :(
